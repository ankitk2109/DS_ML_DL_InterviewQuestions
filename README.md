# Data Science, Machine Learning, & Deep Learning Interview Questions


## Machine Learning

**1. What is Machine learning?**

Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Traditionally, software engineering combined human created rules with data to create answers to a problem. Instead, machine learning uses data and answers to discover the rules behind a problem.

To learn the rules governing a phenomenon, machines have to go through a learning process, trying different rules and learning from how well they perform. Hence, why itâ€™s known as Machine Learning.

**2. What is Supervised and Unsupervised Learning?**

Supervised Learning: Uses known and labeled data as input, with feedback mechanism. Most commonly used supervised learning algorithms are decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machine.

Unsupervised Learning: Uses unlabeled data as input with no feedback mechanism. Most commonly used unsupervised learning algorithms are k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and apriori algorithm.

**3. What is Logistic Regression?**

Logistic regression measures the relationship between the dependent variable (our label of what we want to predict) and one or more independent variables (our features) by estimating probability using its underlying logistic function (sigmoid).
